## Difficulties encountered and their solutions below

### Project Difficulties

1) ValueError message appeared if the consumer entered incorrect information(Ex: letters when numbers are expected)

2) Requesting information from the API and executing code based on the response

3) Deciphering the wanted information from the JSON object after requests were accepted

### Solutions:

1) Using try/except blocks to show an error messages that I wrote

2) Researching the API reference page on Yelpâ€™s developer portal to understand their status codes

3) Since the JSON object gets saved as a hashmap, I isolated the hashmap values and extracted the wanted information using subscripts
